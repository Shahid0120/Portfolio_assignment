                <p>My journey of coding has only started but i can see the love for it. Coding, programming, it's enedless oppotunities. Why dont we create a website? Why dont we create a app? Why dont we create a an innovative product? Its all coding.</p><br><br>

                <p>Studies have shown that one of the most common reasons burnout happens in the workplace is that you don’t have any control over your job’s expectations and activity. While it seems like long work hours are the common reason for burnout, a common feeling for burnout is because their work is not appreciated.</p><br><br>
                <p>Software engineers often switch jobs because they feel like staying in one job stops their growth. Thus, switching jobs is one of the fastest ways to increase one’s net worth and title.</p><br><br>
                <p>As software engineers, we yearn to do meaningful work. That meaningful work, to translate into plain English, is valuable work. It is the work that effort doesn’t go unnoticed. It is the work that brings value to the organization. It is the work that can bring direct translation to one’s performance review, and help us get promoted.</p><br><br>
                <p>There are a lot of ways to create meaningful work and become a valuable member of your team. However, we often misunderstood what counts as being valuable. For instance, we tend to think that working more hours means more value to the company — this isn’t necessarily true. More hours doesn’t necessarily translate to more output, and too many hours, as I said earlier, can lead to burnout and decreased productivity.</p><br><br>
                <p>Another myth about becoming valuable is to be strong in your technical skills. Strong technical skills may be able to get you a good job with a great salary; however, pure strong technical skills alone are not enough to go up the software engineer ladder.</p><br><br>
